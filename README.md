## [Archived Version of My Website](https://ryand939.github.io/discord-bot-dashboard/)

**Note:** This repository is an **OUTDATED** version of my website, originally hosted on GitHub Pages. Since then, I have done the following (as of 11/05/2024):
- Acquired the domains [daer.ca](https://daer.ca) and [daerware.com](https://daerware.com)
- Hosted the site on a VPS for more performance and control
- Ditched Google Firestore and made a PostgreSQL database on the VPS
- Switched to next.js for frontend and built an express.js backend
- Added much more data to the dashboard database table
  
...and I have plenty more things planned!

Feel free to look at this archived version, but check out [bot.daerware.com/dashboard](https://bot.daerware.com/dashboard) for the latest version of this dashboard
