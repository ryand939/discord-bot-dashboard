## [Archived Version of My Website](https://ryand939.github.io/discord-bot-dashboard/)

**Note:** This repository is an **OUTDATED** version of my website, originally hosted on GitHub Pages. Since then, I have done the following (as of 11/05/2024):
- Acquired the domains [daer.ca](https://daer.ca) and [daerware.com](https://daerware.com)
- Hosted the site on a VPS for more performance and control
- Ditched Google Firestore and made a PostgreSQL database on the VPS
- Developed a backend API to serve the frontend react app
- Integrated WebSockets to allow for real-time updates when the database is modified
  
...and I have plenty more things planned!

Feel free to look at this archived version, but check out [daer.ca](https://daer.ca) or [daerware.com](https://daerware.com) for my latest site.
